# Digital-Mapping-Tool

A Python-based mapping tool designed to calculate the shortest path and travel distance between two nodes in a customizable, weighted graph. This tool uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for efficient pathfinding and includes a backtracking mechanism for route visualization.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Computes the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Travel Distance Output**: Displays the total travel distance for the computed path.
- **Customizable Map**: Allows users to create and assign weights to their own nodes and edges, tailoring the map for specific use cases.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Utilizes Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for accurate pathfinding, with custom backtracking to visualize the route taken.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Design Principles**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modularity, extensibility, and reuse.
- **Core Algorithms**: 
  - **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** for shortest path computation.
  - **Custom Backtracking** mechanism for visualizing the optimal route.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main program file responsible for handling the graph setup, user inputs, and shortest path calculations.
- `node.py`: Defines the Node class and related properties, managing each nodeâ€™s connections, weights, and coordinates.
