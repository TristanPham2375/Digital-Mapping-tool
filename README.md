# Digital-Mapping-tool
A Python-based mapping tool for calculating the shortest path and travel distance between two nodes in a customizable, weighted graph. This tool leverages Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for pathfinding and includes a backtracking mechanism to help visualize the route taken.

ðŸ›  Features
Shortest Path Calculation: Computes the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
Travel Distance Output: Displays the travel distance for the computed path.
Customizable Map: Users can create and assign weights to their own nodes and edges for a tailored map.
Efficient Algorithms: Utilizes Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and backtracking to ensure accurate pathfinding.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Language: Python
Design Principles: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modularity and reuse
Core Algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for shortest path, custom backtracking for route visualization

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
main.py: The main program file, handling the graph setup, user inputs, and shortest path calculations.
node.py: Defines the Node class and related properties, managing each nodeâ€™s connections, weights, and coordinates.
